- **Version**: 2025.7.27
- **Status**: In Development
- **Developers**: [Jideeh1](https://github.com/Jideeh1)

Fyi, I lost to a bet and now I have to make an archive of Umamusume Pretty Derby but WITHOUT using any API. Yeah, life's miserable. I'm gonna pour my heart out with this project, so maybe support me at [kofi!](https://ko-fi.com/Manage/)
